### üîë Key Features

* üëÅÔ∏è **Perceptually uniform** colours
* üëå **Semantically sound** names
* üåê **ii8n** friendly 
* ‚ôø **Visually Accessible** by design

### ü§î Choice of Color Space

This library builds over the **HSLUV** Color Space that maps the boundaries of RGB Color Space to the perceptually uniform **CIELCHuv** Color Space, thus circumventing its problem of unbounded chroma. Though this leads to non-uniform chroma, the trade-off is less significant in comparison with other colorspaces: 
* **HSL**‚ùì  While this transformation of RGB color space is more intuitive in its representation, the *lightness* in *HSL* does *not* represent *perceptual lightness* but rather *relative brightness*.
* **Munsell**‚ùì While colors were loosely based on perception, they were mostly inconsistent and dependent on the environment. Moreover, quantitative differences could only be defined over a single color attribute.
* **NCS**‚ùì Based on the psychophysics of color perception, *NCS* is better than *Munsell* as environmental lighting conditions do not impact color choices. However, this system must not be used to model perceived color differences, which is necessary requirement for a naming system to be accessible.
* **LAB**‚ùì Though the *CIELAB* color space represents a broader color gamut with better perceptual accuracy than the *Munsell* System, the parameters **a*** and **b*** makes it harder to arrive at a mental model.

### üé® Designing the Nomenclature of Color

The following schema was arrived at by extracting the best traits from existing naming solutions (such as the Five Color Primaries in *Munsell Naming System*) and selecting linguistically universal color terms. The incorporation of Adjective terms also enhances the learnability and composability by reducing the potential number of color terms to remember.

![Color Schema Visual Representation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arvindcheenu/Chromanomer/master/paper/schematic.jpeg)

For a more detailed look at an object applying this schema, please see the file [`./lang/cono.en.json`](./lang/cono.en.json).

Besides the above considerations while designing the schema, the following were also looked for:
* The arrangement of terms according to increasing order of intensity in chroma and lightness while diverging from the base value of the schema (see *The Handle* in the above schema).
* The arrangement of Warm and Cool Ranges according to the gradatation of hues from adjacent hue sectors.
