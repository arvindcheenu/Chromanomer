# Support

Hi!  ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arvind Srinivasan, the primary author and owner of this repository, speaking on behalf of the OpenSource Chromanomer Community.

I'm really pumped to see that youâ€™re using **Chromanomer** and weâ€™d love to help.
To help me and the community help you, please read through the following guidelines.

Currently, as this budding repository's community is closer to none, all questions will be handled by me.
However, That might not be the case in our near future. 

Please understand that people involved with this project often do so for fun,
next to their day job; you are not entitled to free customer service.

### Where to Ask?

* At this moment, since the community's scale is not large, either you can ask your queries in a new or related issue under the **Issues** Section, or you could directly ping me on [Twitter][twitter]. While I'm fine with responding directly to queries through direct messaging, I prefer you do so only as a last resort.

* Just keep in mind that, as better ways of offering support becomes viable, it will be updated here and would supercede the aforementioned methods.  

### Asking quality questions

Help me and the community help you!

Spending time framing a question and adding support links or resources makes it
much easier for me and the community to help.
Itâ€™s easy to fall into the trap of asking something too specific when youâ€™re
close to a problem.
Then, those trying to help you out have to spend a lot of time asking additional
questions to understand what you are hoping to achieve.

Spending the extra time up front can help save everyone time in the long run.
*   Try to define what you need help with:
    *   Is there something in particular you want to do?
    *   What problem are you encountering and what steps have you taken to try
        and fix it?
    *   Is there a concept youâ€™re not understanding?

*   Learn about the [rubber duck debugging method][rubberduck]
*   Avoid falling for the [XY problem][xy]
*   Search on GitHub to see if a similar question has been asked
*   If possible, provide sample code, video or snapshots of execution along with the necessary context.
*   The more time you put into asking your question, the better I can help you.
