### Footnotes

[1]: *A system is perceptually uniform if a small perturbation to a component value is approximately equally perceptible across the range of that value*. In terms of colour spaces, a small degree of change between hues across the range (0Â°-360Â°) correspond to a similar increase in chroma and lightness that are perceptually equivalent under natural vision.

[2]: Abbreviation for Internationalisation, which in this context, refers to multilingual compatibility.
