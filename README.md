# ðŸŒˆ Chromataxy

**Chromataxy** (abbreviated ***coxy***) is a perceptually intuitive **c**olor **n**aming **s**ystem based on the ***Lightness-Chroma-Hue*** *color space* that covers a sizeable spectrum of colors while boasting a negligible learning curve.
 
 ### Features

* Over **3 lakh** named colors
* **Perceptually uniform**<sup>[1]</sup> colours
* **Semantically sound** names
* **ii8n**<sup>[2]</sup> friendly 
* **Accessible** by design

### Why not other Color Spaces?

* **HSL**  While this transformation of RGB color space is more intuitive in its representation, the *lightness* in *HSL* does *not* represent *perceptual lightness* but rather *relative brightness*.
* **Munsell**  : While colors were loosely based on perception, they were mostly inconsistent and dependent on the environment. Moreover, quantitative differences could only be defined over a single color attribute<sup>[3]</sup>.
* **NCS** : Based on the psychophysics of color perception, *NCS* is better than *Munsell* as environmental lighting conditions do not impact color choices. However, this system must not be used to model perceived color differences<sup>[4]</sup>, which is necessary requirement for a naming system to be accessible.
* **LAB** : Though the *CIELAB* color space represents a broader color gamut with better perceptual accuracy than the *Munsell* System, the parameters **a*** and **b*** makes it harder to arrive at a mental model.

### Designing the Nomenclature of Color

To ensure that the naming system is semantically intuitive and accessible, simple adjectives suffixed with their positive, comparative and superlative forms were used to describe the different dimensions of color.

#### Degrees of Hue Table

All the numbers have units in degrees (not radians). This naming method adds an additional dimension of **temperature** to distinguish transitional colours between two hues, effectively **naming a hue for every *3Â° rotation***. In this table, *Base* denotes only the root colour without a describing adjective being attached to it.

#### Alpha Table

The alpha range **(0 - 100)** is split into **9** (3 forms of 3 comparative adjectives each) **adjectives** with **2** extra stops for denoting *transparent* and *base* colors totalling **11 segments**. In this table, *Base* denotes only the root colour without a describing adjective being attached to it.

| **Alpha (in Percentage)** | **Name**    |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| 0                         | Transparent |
| 10                        | Clearest    |
| 20                        | Clearer     |
| 30                        | Clear       |
| 40                        | Misty       |
| 50                        | Mistier     |
| 60                        | Mistiest    |
| 70                        | Foggy       |
| 80                        | Foggier     |
| 90                        | Foggiest    |
| 100                       | Base        |

Thus, each hue consists of **224 variations of Chroma and Lightness**. Given that there are **126 hues**, About  **28,224 named colors** can be derived. If we factor in the additional dimension of **Transparency**, A staggering collection of **3,10,464 named colors** can be derived.

### Footnotes

[**1**]: *A system is perceptually uniform if a small perturbation to a component value is approximately equally perceptible across the range of that value*. In terms of colour spaces, a small degree of change between hues across the range (0Â°-360Â°) correspond to a similar increase in chroma and lightness that are perceptually equivalent under natural vision.
